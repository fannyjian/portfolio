                <p class="section-text">I'm a penultimate Computer Science student studying in the National University of Singapore, currently interested in the field of Software Engineering. I especially love building my own frontend products, like this website, as I find it so fun! :D</p>
                <p class="section-text">On the side, I love dancing girls' style and kpop. I enjoy shopping alone especially and look at cute (but useless) things too! 💐</p>

                <p class="section-text">My very first major team project! Tuthub is a trusty desktop app designed for professors who wish to keep track of their tutor's peformances and details in a fuss-free and organised way. I enjoyed designing, and building the front end for this project! I also had a touch in implementing features, as well as testing and documentation, and learnt so much from working in a technical team!</p>

                <h3 class="section-heading">Luna 🌙</h3>
                <p class="section-text">My personal favourite :D Luna is a desktop assistant that has all the features to keep track of your tasks in the quickest and most intuitive way possible, and definitely doesn't lack in terms of the aesthetics. I had so much fun designing and building this personal project from scratch, it definitely sparked my interest in pursuing software engineering!</p>
                
                <h3 class="section-heading">Fanta Beauty 🌷</h3>
                <p class="section-text">Fanta Beauty is a social media mobile app that connects individuals interested in the fashion to share or seek advice. As my first independent team project where we were exposed to new tech stack, I gained a valuable experience in full stack design, from brainstorming, implementing to testing and documentation.</p>
